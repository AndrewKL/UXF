Tooltip Package
===============

Summary
-------
The Tooltip is a jQuery plugin that creates light-weight tooltips.  It is not intended to be used as a pop-up or modal dialog, but rather as a more robust replacement for the naitive "title" attribute tooltip.

The tooltip has a few features of note:
*   Support for opening and closing tooltips on the iPad, which of course has no concept of a hover state.
*   The tooltip will dynamically position itself around the specified element if there is not enough room (e.g., at the edge of the browser window).
